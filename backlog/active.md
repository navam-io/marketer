# Marketing Automation MLP – Build Spec (for Claude Code)

## 1. Overview

**Product:** Navam Marketer (MLP edition)  
**Audience / ICP:** Bootstrapped startup founders who need to quickly turn existing content (website, blog, or product page) into social promotions (LinkedIn posts, tweets, short blogs) without hiring a marketing team.

**Goal:**  
Automate content → promo generation → scheduling → simple analytics, using Claude (via Bedrock/Anthropic) + minimal full-stack code.

---

## 2. Core Principles

- **MLP, not MVP**: deliver *delight* with minimal code — it must be usable and visually pleasing.  
- **Human in Loop**: each feature slice can be reviewed or edited by the founder before publishing.  
- **Single repo**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + Tailwind + Prisma.  
- **Claude-ready**: every feature exposed through API route for LLM orchestration.  
- **Local-first**: runs with SQLite and serverless deploy later (Vercel + Neon).

## 5. Development Workflow (Human-in-Loop)

1. **Pick one slice** below.  
2. Claude builds the implementation incrementally (UI + API + schema).  
3. You run locally (`pnpm dev`), evaluate UX + correctness.  
4. Approve or revise → move to next slice.

**Recommended Order**
1. Slice 1 – Source Ingestion  
2. Slice 2 – Kanban Tasks  
3. Slice 3 – Claude Generation  
4. Slice 4 – Scheduling  
5. Slice 5 – Dashboard  
6. Slice 6 – Auth (optional)

---

## 6. Example Claude Command Prompts

### Build a Slice
> Implement *Slice 1 – Source Ingestion* from the MLP Spec.  
> Include both frontend and backend code in Next.js 15 with Prisma models.  
> Use shadcn/ui and Tailwind for styling.  
> Output runnable code and brief usage steps.

### Evaluate a Slice
> Review output from previous slice, run it locally, and suggest UX/code improvements.

---

## 7. Deliverables

Each slice must include:
- Updated Prisma schema (if needed)
- Next.js route(s)
- UI components (page, modal, or board)
- Example data (seed)
- Test command to verify flow locally
